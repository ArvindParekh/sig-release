  text: 'kubeadm: added better handling of errors during unmount when calling "kubeadm
    reset". When failing to unmount directories under "/var/run/kubelet", kubeadm
    will now throw an error instead of showing a warning and continuing to cleanup
    said directory. In such situations it is better for you to inspect the problem
    and resolve it manually, then you can call "kubeadm reset" again to complete the
    cleanup.'
