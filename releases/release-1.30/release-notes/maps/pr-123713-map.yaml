  text: The initialization of nodes using external cloud-providers now waits for the
    providerID value to be available before untainting it. This is required because
    if there are communication errors with the cloud-provider on the cloud-controller-manager,
    nodes may have been declared Ready without having this field or the zone labels,
    and this information was never reconciled. The providerID and the zone labels
    are required for integrations like loadbalancers to work correctly. Cloud providers
    that does not implement the `GetInstanceProviderID` method will not require the
    providerID to be set and will not fail to initialize the node for backward compatibility
    issues.
