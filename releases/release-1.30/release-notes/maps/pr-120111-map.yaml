  text: 'Added the namespace when using ''kubectl logs <pod-name>'' and the pod is
    not found. Previously the message returned would be ''Error from server (NotFound):
    pods "my-pod-name" not found''. This has been updated to reflect the namespace
    in the message as follows: ''Error from server (NotFound): pods "my-pod-name"
    not found in namespace "default"'''
