    The deprecated `SecurityContextDeny` admission plugin, which has been deprecated since `v1.27`, has been removed. It is recommended to use the Pod Security Admission plugin instead, which has been available since v1.25. Refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#securitycontextdeny) for more information.
