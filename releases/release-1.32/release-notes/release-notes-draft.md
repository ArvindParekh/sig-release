## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- ACTION REQUIRED for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  `PodEligibleToPreemptOthers` in the `preemption` interface gets `ctx` in the parameters.
  Please change your plugins' implementation accordingly. ([#126465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126465), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Scheduling]
 - Changed NodeToStatusMap from map to struct and exposed methods to access the entries. Added absentNodesStatus, which inform what is the status of nodes that are absent in the map. 
  
  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, make sure to update usage of NodeToStatusMap. Additionally, NodeToStatusMap should be eventually renamed to NodeToStatusReader. ([#126022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126022), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Reverted the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to default-off to give a full year from deprecation announcement in 1.29 to clearing the field by default, per the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/). ([#126720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126720), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Architecture and Node]

### API Change

- Allow for Pod search domains to be a single dot "." or contain an underscore "_" ([#127167](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127167), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Apps, Network and Testing]
- Disallow `k8s.io` and `kubernetes.io` namespaced extra key in structured authentication configuration. ([#126553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126553), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixed a bug in the `NestedNumberAsFloat64` Unstructured field accessor that could have caused it to return rounded float64 values instead of errors when accessing very large int64 values. ([#128099](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128099), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- Fixed the bug where `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` of the pod will always be overwritten by the MaxPodGracePeriodSeconds of the soft eviction, you can enable the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate, which will restore the previous behavior.  If you do need to set this, please file an issue with the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand why you needed it. ([#122890](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122890), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Introduced compressible resource setting on system reserved and kube reserved slices ([#125982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125982), [@harche](https://github.com/harche))
- Kube-scheduler removed `AzureDiskLimits` ,`CinderLimits` `EBSLimits` and `GCEPDLimits` plugin. Given the corresponding CSI driver reports how many volumes a node can handle in NodeGetInfoResponse, the kubelet stores this limit in CSINode and the scheduler then knows the limit of the driver on the node. Removed plugins AzureDiskLimits, CinderLimits, EBSLimits and GCEPDLimits if you explicitly enabled them in the scheduler config. ([#124003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124003), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kubelet: the `--image-credential-provider-config` file was loaded with strict deserialization, which failed if the config file contained duplicate or unknown fields. This protected against accidentally running with malformed config files, mis-indented files, or typos in field names, and prevented unexpected behavior. ([#128062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128062), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- Promoted `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` to stable; the feature was enabled by default. The `--feature-gates=CustomResourceFieldSelectors=true` flag was no longer needed on kube-apiserver binaries and would be removed in a future release. ([#127673](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127673), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- The default value for node-monitor-grace-period has been increased to 50s (earlier 40s) (Ref - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121793) ([#126287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126287), [@devppratik](https://github.com/devppratik)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The resource/v1alpha3.ResourceSliceList filed which should have been named "metadata" but was instead named "listMeta" is now properly "metadata". ([#126749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126749), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The synthetic "Bookmark" event for the watch stream requests will now include a new annotation: `kubernetes.io/initial-events-list-blueprint`. THe annotation contains an empty, versioned list that is encoded in the requested format (such as protobuf, JSON, or CBOR), then base64-encoded and stored as a string. ([#127587](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127587), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions.
  Name format CEL library is supported in new expressions. ([#126977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126977), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Updated incorrect description of persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy ([#126545](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126545), [@yangjunmyfm192085](https://github.com/yangjunmyfm192085)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and CLI]
- X.509 client certificate authentication to the kube-apiserver now produces credential IDs (derived from the certificate's signature) , for use in audit logging. ([#125634](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125634), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

### Feature

- Added an option to enable leader election in local-up-cluster.sh via the LEADER_ELECT CLI flag. ([#127786](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127786), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree))
- Added new functionality into the Go client code (`client-go`) library. The `List()` method for the metadata client allows enabling API streaming when fetching collections; this improves performance when listing many objects.
  To request this behaviour, your client software must enable the `WatchListClient` client-go feature gate. Additionally, streaming is only available if supported by the cluster; the API server that you connect to must also support streaming.
  If the API server does not support or allow streaming, then `client-go` falls back to fetching the collection using the **list** API verb. ([#127388](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127388), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]

- Implemented new cluster events `UpdatePodSchedulingGatesEliminated` and `UpdatePodTolerations` for scheduler plugins. ([#127083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127083), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Improved `Node QueueHint` in the `NodeAffinty` plugin by ignoring unrelated changes that keep pods unschedulable. ([#127444](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127444), [@dom4ha](https://github.com/dom4ha)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Improved `Node QueueHint` in the `NodeResource Fit` plugin by ignoring unrelated changes that keep pods unschedulable. ([#127473](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127473), [@dom4ha](https://github.com/dom4ha)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Improved performance of the job controller when handling job delete events. ([#127378](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127378), [@hakuna-matatah](https://github.com/hakuna-matatah))
- Improved performance of the job controller when handling job update events. ([#127228](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127228), [@hakuna-matatah](https://github.com/hakuna-matatah))
- Included an additional resource labeltransformati in on_operations_total metric which could be used for resource specific validations for example handling of encryption config by the apiserver. ([#126512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126512), [@kmala](https://github.com/kmala)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Etcd and Testing]
- JWT authenticators now set the `jti` claim (if present and is a string value) as credential id for use by audit logging. ([#127010](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127010), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: a new `--requestheader-uid-headers` flag allows configuring request header authentication to obtain the authenticating user's UID from the specified headers. The suggested value for the new option is `X-Remote-Uid`. When specified, the `kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication` configmap will include the value in its `.data[requestheader-uid-headers]` field. ([#115834](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115834), [@stlaz](https://github.com/stlaz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Testing]
- Kube-proxy uses  field-selector clusterIP!=None on Services to avoid watching for Headless Services, reduce  unnecessary network bandwidth ([#126769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126769), [@Sakuralbj](https://github.com/Sakuralbj)) [SIG Network]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade apply` now supports phase sub-command, user can use `kubeadm upgrade apply phase <phase-name>` to execute the specified phase, or use `kubeadm upgrade apply --skip-phases <phase-names>` to skip some phases during cluster upgrade. ([#126032](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126032), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade node` now supports `addon` and `post-upgrade` phases. User can use `kubeadm upgrade node phase addon` to execute the addon upgrade, or use `kubeadm upgrade node --skip-phases addon` to skip the addon upgrade. Currently, the `post-upgrade` phase is no-op, and it is mainly used to handle some release specific post-upgrade tasks. ([#127242](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127242), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: add a validation warning when the certificateValidityPeriod is more than the caCertificateValidityPeriod ([#126538](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126538), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: allow mixing the flag --config with the special flag --print-manifest of the subphases of 'kubeadm init phase addon'. ([#126740](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126740), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if an unknown command name is passed to any parent command such as 'kubeadm init phase' return an error. If 'kubeadm init phase' or another command that has subcommands is called without subcommand name, print the available commands and also return an error. ([#127096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127096), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: promoted feature gate `EtcdLearnerMode` to GA. Learner mode in etcd deployed by kubeadm is now locked to enabled by default. ([#126374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126374), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubelet: add log and event for cgroup v2 with kernel older than 5.8. ([#126595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126595), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Node]

- Output for the `ScalingReplicaSet` event has changed from:
      Scaled <up|down> replica set <replica-set-name> to <new-value> from <old-value>
  to:
      Scaled <up|down> replica set <replica-set-name> from <old-value> to <new-value>. ([#125118](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125118), [@jsoref](https://github.com/jsoref)) [SIG Apps and CLI]
- Pods were allowed to use the `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` and `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem` sysctl by default
  when the kernel version was 4.15 or higher. With the kernel 4.15 the sysctl became namespaced.
  Pod Security admission allowed these sysctl in v1.32+ versions of the baseline and restricted policies. ([#127489](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127489), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Auth, Network and Node]
- Promoted `RetryGenerateName` to stable; the feature is enabled by default. `--feature-gates=RetryGenerateName=true` not needed on kube-apiserver binaries and will be removed in a future release. ([#127093](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127093), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Promoted the feature gates `StrictCostEnforcementForVAP` and `StrictCostEnforcementForWebhooks` ([#127302](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127302), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Removed attachable volume limits from the capacity of the node for the following
  volume type when the kubelet was started, affecting the following volume types
  when the corresponding csi driver was installed:
  - `awsElasticBlockStore` for `ebs.csi.aws.com`
  - `azureDisk` for `disk.csi.azure.com`
  - `gcePersistentDisk` for `pd.csi.storage.googleapis.com`
  - `cinder` for `cinder.csi.openstack.org`
  - `csi`
  However it was still enforced using a limit in CSINode objects. ([#126924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126924), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Reverted Go version used to build Kubernetes to 1.23.0. ([#127861](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127861), [@xmudrii](https://github.com/xmudrii)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Support inflight_events metric in the scheduler for QueueingHint (alpha feature). ([#127052](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127052), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Support specifying a custom network parameter when running e2e-node-tests with the remote option. ([#127574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127574), [@bouaouda-achraf](https://github.com/bouaouda-achraf)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- The scheduler implemented QueueingHint in VolumeBinding plugin's CSIDriver event, which enhanced the throughput of scheduling. ([#125171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125171), [@YamasouA](https://github.com/YamasouA)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- The scheduler retries gated Pods more appropriately, giving them a backoff penalty too. ([#126029](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126029), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Unallowed label values will show up as "unexpected" in scheduler metrics ([#126762](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126762), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Vendor: updated system-validators to v1.9.0 ([#128149](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128149), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- When SchedulerQueueingHint is enabled,
  the scheduler's in-tree plugins now subscribe to specific node events to decide whether to requeue Pods.
  This allows the scheduler to handle cluster events faster with less memory.
  
  Specific node events include updates to taints, tolerations or allocatable.
  In-tree plugins now ignore node updates that don't modify any of these fields. ([#127220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127220), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Storage]

### Documentation

- Clarified the kube-controller-manager documentation for --allocate-node-cidrs, --cluster-cidr, and --service-cluster-ip-range flags to accurately reflect their dependencies and usage conditions. ([#126784](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126784), [@eminwux](https://github.com/eminwux)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Docs]
- Documented the `--for=create` option to `kubectl wait` ([#127327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127327), [@ryanwinter](https://github.com/ryanwinter)) [SIG CLI]
- Kubeadm: fixed a misleading output (typo) when executing the "kubeadm init" command. ([#128118](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128118), [@amaddio](https://github.com/amaddio))

### Failing Test

- Kubelet Plugins are now re-registered properly  on Windows if the re-registration period is < 15ms. ([#114136](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114136), [@claudiubelu](https://github.com/claudiubelu)) [SIG Node, Storage, Testing and Windows]

### Bug or Regression

- API emulation versioning honors cohabitating resources ([#127239](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127239), [@xuzhenglun](https://github.com/xuzhenglun)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Apiserver repair controller is resilient to etcd errors during bootstrap and retries during 30 seconds before failing. ([#126671](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126671), [@fusida](https://github.com/fusida)) [SIG Network]
- Applyconfiguration-gen no longer generates duplicate methods and ambiguous member accesses when types end up with multiple members of the same name (through embedded structs). ([#127001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127001), [@skitt](https://github.com/skitt)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Bookmark events are now sent immediately after all items in the watchCache store have been processed, improving consistency in client behavior. ([#127012](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127012), [@Chaunceyctx](https://github.com/Chaunceyctx))
- DRA: when a DRA driver was started after creating pods which need resources from that driver, no additional attempt was made to schedule such unschedulable pods again. Only affected DRA with structured parameters. ([#126807](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126807), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: when enabling the scheduler queuing hint feature, pods got stuck as unschedulable for a while unnecessarily because recording the name of the generated ResourceClaim did not trigger scheduling. ([#127497](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127497), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Discarded the output streams of destination path check in kubectl cp when copying from local to pod and added a 3 seconds timeout to this check ([#126652](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126652), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI]
- Fixed a bug in the endpoints controller that failed to reconcile the Endpoint object after it was truncated (when it received more than 1000 endpoint addresses). ([#127417](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127417), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Apps, Network and Testing]
- Fixed a bug in the garbage collector controller which could block indefinitely due to a cache sync failure. This fix allows the garbage collector to eventually continue garbage collecting other resources if a given resource cannot be listed or watched. Any objects in the unsynced resource type with owner references with `blockOwnerDeletion: true` will not be known to the garbage collector. Use of `blockOwnerDeletion` has always been best-effort and racy on startup and object creation. With this fix, it continues to be best-effort for resources that cannot be synced by the garbage collector controller. ([#125796](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125796), [@haorenfsa](https://github.com/haorenfsa)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Fixed a bug that occurred when the hostname label of a node did not match the node name, pods bound to a PV with nodeAffinity using the hostname may be scheduled to the wrong node or experience scheduling failures. ([#125398](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125398), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Fixed a bug where init containers may fail to start due to a temporary container runtime failure. ([#126543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126543), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed a bug where the kubelet ephemerally failed with `failed to initialize top level QOS containers: root container [kubepods] doesn't exist`, due to the cpuset cgroup being deleted on v2 with systemd cgroup manager. ([#125923](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125923), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Fixed a bug which the scheduler didn't correctly tell plugins Node deletion.
  This bug could impact all scheduler plugins subscribing to Node/Delete event, making the queue keep the Pods rejected by those plugins incorrectly at Node deletion. Among the in-tree plugins, PodTopologySpread is the only victim. ([#127464](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127464), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Fixed a bug with dual stack clusters using the beta feature MultiCIDRServiceAllocator which could not create dual stack Services or Services with IPs in the secondary range. Users who wanted to use this feature in version 1.30 with dual stack clusters could work around the issue by setting the feature gate DisableAllocatorDualWrite to true. ([#127598](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127598), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Fixed a possible memory leak in the QueueingHint (alpha feature). ([#126962](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126962), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Fixed a potential memory leak in QueueingHint (alpha feature). ([#127016](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127016), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Fixed a race condition in the kube-proxy initialization that could cause UDP traffic to service VIP. ([#126532](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126532), [@wedaly](https://github.com/wedaly))
- Fixed a race condition that could result in erroneous volume unmounts for flex volume plugins during kubelet restart ([#127669](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127669), [@olyazavr](https://github.com/olyazavr))
- Fixed a regression in 1.29+ default configurations, where regular init containers may fail to start due to a temporary container runtime failure. ([#127162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127162), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed a regression introduced in v1.29 where conntrack entries for UDP connections
  to deleted pods did not get cleaned up correctly, which could (among other things)
  cause DNS problems when DNS pods were restarted. ([#127780](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127780), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))
- Fixed a scheduler preemption issue where the victim pod was not deleted due to incorrect status patching. This issue occurred when the preemptor and victim pods had different QoS classes in their status, causing the preemption to fail entirely. ([#126644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126644), [@Huang-Wei](https://github.com/Huang-Wei))
