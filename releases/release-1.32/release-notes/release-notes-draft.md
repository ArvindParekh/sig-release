## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- ACTION REQUIRED for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  `PodEligibleToPreemptOthers` in the `preemption` interface gets `ctx` in the parameters.
  Please change your plugins' implementation accordingly. ([#126465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126465), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Scheduling]
 - Changed NodeToStatusMap from map to struct and exposed methods to access the entries. Added absentNodesStatus, which inform what is the status of nodes that are absent in the map. 
  
  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, make sure to update usage of NodeToStatusMap. Additionally, NodeToStatusMap should be eventually renamed to NodeToStatusReader. ([#126022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126022), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Reverted the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to default-off to give a full year from deprecation announcement in 1.29 to clearing the field by default, per the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/). ([#126720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126720), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Architecture and Node]

### API Change

- Allow for Pod search domains to be a single dot "." or contain an underscore "_" ([#127167](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127167), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Apps, Network and Testing]
- Disallow `k8s.io` and `kubernetes.io` namespaced extra key in structured authentication configuration. ([#126553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126553), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixed the bug where spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds of the pod will always be overwritten by the MaxPodGracePeriodSeconds of the soft eviction, you can enable the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate, which will restore the previous behavior.  If you do need to set this, please file an issue with the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand why you need it. ([#122890](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122890), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler removed the following plugins: - AzureDiskLimits - CinderLimits - EBSLimits - GCEPDLimits Because the corresponding CSI driver reports how many volumes a node can handle in NodeGetInfoResponse, the kubelet stores this limit in CSINode and the scheduler then knows the driver's limit on the node. Remove plugins AzureDiskLimits, CinderLimits, EBSLimits and GCEPDLimits if you explicitly enabled them in the scheduler config. ([#124003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124003), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- The default value for node-monitor-grace-period has been increased to 50s (earlier 40s) (Ref - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121793) ([#126287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126287), [@devppratik](https://github.com/devppratik)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The resource/v1alpha3.ResourceSliceList filed which should have been named "metadata" but was instead named "listMeta" is now properly "metadata". ([#126749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126749), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The synthetic "Bookmark" event for the watch stream requests will now include a new annotation: `kubernetes.io/initial-events-list-blueprint`. THe annotation contains an empty, versioned list that is encoded in the requested format (such as protobuf, JSON, or CBOR), then base64-encoded and stored as a string. ([#127587](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127587), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions.
  Name format CEL library is supported in new expressions. ([#126977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126977), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Release, Scheduling and Testing]

- X.509 client certificate authentication to kube-apiserver now produces credential IDs (derived from the certificate's signature) for use by audit logging. ([#125634](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125634), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

### Feature

- Added new functionality into the Go client code (`client-go`) library. The `List()` method for the metadata client allows enabling API streaming when fetching collections; this improves performance when listing many objects.
  To request this behaviour, your client software must enable the `WatchListClient` client-go feature gate. Additionally, streaming is only available if supported by the cluster; the API server that you connect to must also support streaming.
  If the API server does not support or allow streaming, then `client-go` falls back to fetching the collection using the **list** API verb. ([#127388](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127388), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]

- Fixed kubectl doesn't print image volume when kubectl describe a pod with that volume ([#126706](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126706), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Graduate the AnonymousAuthConfigurableEndpoints feature gate to beta and enable by default to allow configurable endpoints for anonymous authentication. ([#127009](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127009), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG Auth]
- Implemented a queueing hint for PersistentVolumeClaim/Add event in CSILimit plugin. ([#124703](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124703), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Implemented new cluster events UpdatePodSchedulingGatesEliminated and UpdatePodTolerations for scheduler plugins. ([#127083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127083), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Improved Node QueueHint in the NodeAffinty plugin by ignoring unrelated changes that keep pods unschedulable. ([#127444](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127444), [@dom4ha](https://github.com/dom4ha)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]

- JWT authenticators now set the `jti` claim (if present and is a string value) as credential id for use by audit logging. ([#127010](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127010), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: a new `--requestheader-uid-headers` flag allows configuring request header authentication to obtain the authenticating user's UID from the specified headers. The suggested value for the new option is `X-Remote-Uid`. When specified, the `kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication` configmap will include the value in its `.data[requestheader-uid-headers]` field. ([#115834](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115834), [@stlaz](https://github.com/stlaz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Testing]
- Kube-proxy uses  field-selector clusterIP!=None on Services to avoid watching for Headless Services, reduce  unnecessary network bandwidth ([#126769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126769), [@Sakuralbj](https://github.com/Sakuralbj)) [SIG Network]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade apply` now supports phase sub-command, user can use `kubeadm upgrade apply phase <phase-name>` to execute the specified phase, or use `kubeadm upgrade apply --skip-phases <phase-names>` to skip some phases during cluster upgrade. ([#126032](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126032), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade node` now supports `addon` and `post-upgrade` phases. User can use `kubeadm upgrade node phase addon` to execute the addon upgrade, or use `kubeadm upgrade node --skip-phases addon` to skip the addon upgrade. Currently, the `post-upgrade` phase is no-op, and it is mainly used to handle some release specific post-upgrade tasks. ([#127242](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127242), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: add a validation warning when the certificateValidityPeriod is more than the caCertificateValidityPeriod ([#126538](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126538), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: allow mixing the flag --config with the special flag --print-manifest of the subphases of 'kubeadm init phase addon'. ([#126740](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126740), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if an unknown command name is passed to any parent command such as 'kubeadm init phase' return an error. If 'kubeadm init phase' or another command that has subcommands is called without subcommand name, print the available commands and also return an error. ([#127096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127096), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: promoted feature gate `EtcdLearnerMode` to GA. Learner mode in etcd deployed by kubeadm is now locked to enabled by default. ([#126374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126374), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubelet: add log and event for cgroup v2 with kernel older than 5.8. ([#126595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126595), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Node]
- Kubernetes is now built with go 1.23.0 ([#127076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127076), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Promoted `RetryGenerateName` to stable; the feature is enabled by default. `--feature-gates=RetryGenerateName=true` not needed on kube-apiserver binaries and will be removed in a future release. ([#127093](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127093), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Support inflight_events metric in the scheduler for QueueingHint (alpha feature). ([#127052](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127052), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Support specifying a custom network parameter when running e2e-node-tests with the remote option. ([#127574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127574), [@bouaouda-achraf](https://github.com/bouaouda-achraf)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- The scheduler retries gated Pods more appropriately, giving them a backoff penalty too. ([#126029](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126029), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- The transformation_operations_total metric had an additional resource label which could be used for resource specific validations for example handling of encryption config by the apiserver. ([#126512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126512), [@kmala](https://github.com/kmala)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Etcd and Testing]
- Unallowed label values will show up as "unexpected" in scheduler metrics ([#126762](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126762), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- When SchedulerQueueingHint is enabled,
  the scheduler's in-tree plugins now subscribe to specific node events to decide whether to requeue Pods.
  This allows the scheduler to handle cluster events faster with less memory.
  
  Specific node events include updates to taints, tolerations or allocatable.
  In-tree plugins now ignore node updates that don't modify any of these fields. ([#127220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127220), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- When SchedulerQueueingHints is enabled, clear events cached in the scheduling queue as soon as possible so that the scheduler consumes less memory. ([#120586](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120586), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]

### Documentation

- Clarified the kube-controller-manager documentation for --allocate-node-cidrs, --cluster-cidr, and --service-cluster-ip-range flags to accurately reflect their dependencies and usage conditions. ([#126784](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126784), [@eminwux](https://github.com/eminwux)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Docs]
- Documented the `--for=create` option to `kubectl wait` ([#127327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127327), [@ryanwinter](https://github.com/ryanwinter)) [SIG CLI]

### Failing Test

- Kubelet Plugins are now re-registered properly on Windows if the re-registration period is < 15ms. ([#114136](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114136), [@claudiubelu](https://github.com/claudiubelu)) [SIG Node, Storage, Testing and Windows]

### Bug or Regression

- API emulation versioning honors cohabitating resources ([#127239](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127239), [@xuzhenglun](https://github.com/xuzhenglun)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Apiserver repair controller is resilient to etcd errors during bootstrap and retries during 30 seconds before failing. ([#126671](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126671), [@fusida](https://github.com/fusida)) [SIG Network]
- Applyconfiguration-gen no longer generates duplicate methods and ambiguous member accesses when types end up with multiple members of the same name (through embedded structs). ([#127001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127001), [@skitt](https://github.com/skitt)) [SIG API Machinery]
- DRA: when a DRA driver was started after creating pods which need resources from that driver, no additional attempt was made to schedule such unschedulable pods again. Only affected DRA with structured parameters. ([#126807](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126807), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: when enabling the scheduler queuing hint feature, pods got stuck as unschedulable for a while unnecessarily because recording the name of the generated ResourceClaim did not trigger scheduling. ([#127497](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127497), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Discarded the output streams of destination path check in kubectl cp when copying from local to pod and added a 3 seconds timeout to this check ([#126652](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126652), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI]
- Fixed CEL estimated cost of expressions that perform equality checks of IPs, CIDRs, Quantities, Formats and URLs. ([#126359](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126359), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz))
- Fixed a bug in the garbage collector controller which could block indefinitely on a cache sync failure. This fix allows the garbage collector to eventually continue garbage collecting other resources if a given resource cannot be listed or watched. Any objects in the unsynced resource type with owner references with `blockOwnerDeletion: true` will not be known to the garbage collector. Use of `blockOwnerDeletion` has always been best-effort and racy on startup and object creation, with this fix, it continues to be best-effort for resources that cannot be synced by the garbage collector controller. ([#125796](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125796), [@haorenfsa](https://github.com/haorenfsa)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]

([#125398](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125398), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Fixed a bug where init containers may fail to start due to a temporary container runtime failure. ([#126543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126543), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed a bug which the scheduler didn't correctly tell plugins Node deletion.
  This bug could impact all scheduler plugins subscribing to Node/Delete event, making the queue keep the Pods rejected by those plugins incorrectly at Node deletion. Among the in-tree plugins, PodTopologySpread is the only victim. ([#127464](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127464), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Fixed a bug with dual stack clusters using the beta feature MultiCIDRServiceAllocator can not create dual stack Services or Services with IPs on the secondary range.

- Fixed a regression in 1.29+ default configurations, where regular init containers may fail to start due to a temporary container runtime failure. ([#127162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127162), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed a scheduler preemption issue where the victim pod was not deleted due to incorrect status patching. This issue occurred when the preemptor and victim pods had different QoS classes in their status, causing the preemption to fail entirely. ([#126644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126644), [@Huang-Wei](https://github.com/Huang-Wei))
- Fixed an issue where requests sent by the KMSv2 service would be rejected due to having an invalid authority header. ([#126930](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126930), [@Ruddickmg](https://github.com/Ruddickmg)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]

- Fixed the bug in NodeUnschedulable that only happens with QHint enabled, which the scheduler might miss some updates for the Pods rejected by NodeUnschedulable plugin and put the Pods in the queue for a longer time than needed. ([#127427](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127427), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Fixed the wrong hierarchical structure for the child span and the parent span (i.e. `SerializeObject` and `List`). In the past, some children's spans appeared parallel to their parents. ([#127551](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127551), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Fixed: dynamic client-go can now handle subresources with an UnstructuredList response ([#126809](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126809), [@ryantxu](https://github.com/ryantxu)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixes a bug where restartable and non-restartable init containers were not accounted for in the message and annotations of eviction event. ([#124947](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124947), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus)) [SIG Node]
- Fixes the bug in PodTopologySpread that only happens with QHint enabled, 
  which the scheduler might miss some updates for the Pods rejected by PodTopologySpread plugin and put the Pods in the queue for a longer time than needed. ([#127447](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127447), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- HostNetwork pods no longer depend on the PodIPs to be assigned to configure the defined hostAliases on the Pod ([#126460](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126460), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network, Node and Testing]
- If a client makes an API streaming requests and specifies an `application/json;as=Table` content type, the API server now responds with a 406 (Not Acceptable) error.
  This change helps to ensure that unsupported formats, such as `Table` representations are correctly rejected. ([#126996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126996), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- If an old pod spec has used image volume source, we must allow it when updating the resource even if the feature-gate ImageVolume is disabled. ([#126733](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126733), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- Improved PVC Protection Controller's scalability by batch-processing PVCs by namespace with lazy live pod listing. ([#125372](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125372), [@hungnguyen243](https://github.com/hungnguyen243)) [SIG Apps, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Improved PVC Protection Controller's scalability by batch-processing PVCs by namespace with lazy live pod listing. ([#126745](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126745), [@hungnguyen243](https://github.com/hungnguyen243)) [SIG Apps, Storage and Testing]

- Kubeadm: ensure that Pods from the upgrade preflight check `CreateJob` are properly terminated after a timeout. ([#127333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127333), [@yuyabee](https://github.com/yuyabee)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: when adding new control plane nodes with "kubeamd join", ensure that the etcd member addition is performed only if a given member URL does not already exist in the list of members. Similarly, on "kubeadm reset" only remove an etcd member if its ID exists. ([#127491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127491), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubelet now attempts to get an existing node if the request to create it fails with StatusForbidden. ([#126318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126318), [@hoskeri](https://github.com/hoskeri)) [SIG Node]
- Kubelet: use the CRI stats provider if `PodAndContainerStatsFromCRI` feature is enabled ([#126488](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126488), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander)) [SIG Node]
- Removed unneeded permissions for system:controller:persistent-volume-binder and system:controller:expand-controller clusterroles ([#125995](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125995), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Auth and Storage]

- Send bookmark right now after sending all items in watchCache store ([#127012](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127012), [@Chaunceyctx](https://github.com/Chaunceyctx))
- Terminated Pods on a node will not be re-admitted on kubelet restart. This fixes the problem of Completed Pods awaiting for the finalizer marked as Failed after the kubelet restart. ([#126343](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126343), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- The CSI volume plugin stopped watching the VolumeAttachment object if the object is not found or the volume is not attached when kubelet waits for a volume attached. In the past, it would fail due to missing permission. ([#126961](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126961), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Storage]
