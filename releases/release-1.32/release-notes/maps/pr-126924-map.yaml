    Removed attachable volume limits from the capacity of the node for the following
    volume type when the kubelet was started, affecting the following volume types
    when the corresponding csi driver was installed:
    - `awsElasticBlockStore` for `ebs.csi.aws.com`
    - `azureDisk` for `disk.csi.azure.com`
    - `gcePersistentDisk` for `pd.csi.storage.googleapis.com`
    - `cinder` for `cinder.csi.openstack.org`
    - `csi`
    However it was still enforced using a limit in CSINode objects.
