  text: 'kube-apiserver: Promoted `AuthorizeWithSelectors` feature to beta, which
    includes field and label selector information from requests in webhook authorization
    calls. Promoted `AuthorizeNodeWithSelectors` feature to beta, which changes node
    authorizer behavior to limit requests from node API clients, so that each Node
    can only get / list / watch its own Node API object, and can also only get / list
    / watch Pod API objects bound to that node. Clients using kubelet credentials
    to read other nodes or unrelated pods must change their authentication credentials
    (recommended), adjust their usage, or obtain broader read access independent of
    the node authorizer.'
