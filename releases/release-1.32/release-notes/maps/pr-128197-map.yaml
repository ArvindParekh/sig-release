  text: Removed legacy cloud provider integration code and the "service-lb-controller",
    "cloud-node-lifecycle-controller" and the "node-route-controller" from kube-controller-manager.
    You can now either set the `--cloud-provider` command line argument to "external",
    or to the empty string. All other values are invalid.
