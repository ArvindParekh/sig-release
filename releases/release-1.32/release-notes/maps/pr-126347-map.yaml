    Revised the Kubelet API Authorization with new subresources, that allow finer-grained authorization checks and access control for kubelet endpoints.
    Provided you enable the `KubeletFineGrainedAuthz` feature gate, you can access kubelet's `/healthz` endpoint by granting the caller `nodes/helathz` permission in RBAC.
    Similarly you can also access  kubelet's `/pods` endpoint to fetch a list of Pods bound to that node by granting the caller `nodes/pods` permission in RBAC.
    Similarly you can also access kubelet's `/configz` endpoint to fetch kubelet's configuration by granting the caller `nodes/configz` permission in RBAC.
    You can still access kubelet's `/healthz`, `/pods` and `/configz` by granting the caller `nodes/proxy` permission in RBAC but that also grants the caller permissions to exec, run and attach to containers on the nodes and doing so does not follow the least privilege principle. Granting callers more permissions than they need can give attackers an opportunity to escalate privileges.
