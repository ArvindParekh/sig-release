  text: Fixed the bug where `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` of the pod will always
    be overwritten by the MaxPodGracePeriodSeconds of the soft eviction, you can enable
    the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate, which will restore
    the previous behavior.  If you do need to set this, please file an issue with
    the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand why you needed it.
