  text: "Fixed the bug of InPlacePodVerticalScaling state un-marshalling. State stored in `/var/lib/kubelet/pod_status_manager_state` now can always be read back after kubelet restart. Since the checkpoint format was changed to fix the issue, if you are using the feature `InPlacePodVerticalScaling`, please clean up the state file `/var/lib/kubelet/pod_status_manager_state` when upgrading the kubelet as failure to do it will lead to incompatible state formats and kubelet's failure to start."
