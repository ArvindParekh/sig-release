  text: 'Fixed a bug in the garbage collector controller which could block indefinitely
    due to a cache sync failure. This fix allows the garbage collector to eventually continue
    garbage collecting other resources if a given resource cannot be listed or watched.
    Any objects in the unsynced resource type with owner references with `blockOwnerDeletion:
    true` will not be known to the garbage collector. Use of `blockOwnerDeletion`
    has always been best-effort and racy on startup and object creation. With this
    fix, it continues to be best-effort for resources that cannot be synced by the
    garbage collector controller.'
