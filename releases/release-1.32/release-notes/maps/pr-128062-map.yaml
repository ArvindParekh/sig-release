  text: 'kubelet: the `--image-credential-provider-config` file was loaded with strict
    deserialization, which failed if the config file contained duplicate or unknown
    fields. This protected against accidentally running with malformed config files,
    unindented files, or typos in field names, and it prevented unexpected behavior.'
