    When adding links which point to resources within git repositories, like
    KEPs or supporting documentation, please reference a specific commit and avoid
    linking directly to the master branch. This ensures that links reference a
    specific point in time, rather than a document that may change over time.

    See here for guidance on getting permanent links to files: https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files.
