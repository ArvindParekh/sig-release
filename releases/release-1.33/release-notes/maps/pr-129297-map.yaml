  text: Promoted the feature gate `CSIMigrationPortworx` to GA. If your applications
    are using Portworx volumes, please make sure that the corresponding Portworx CSI
    driver is installed on your cluster **before** upgrading to 1.31 or later because
    all operations for the in-tree `portworxVolume` type are redirected to the pxd.portworx.com
    CSI driver when the feature gate is enabled.
