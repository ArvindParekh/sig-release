    New configuration is introduced to the kubelet that allows it to track container images and the list of authentication information that lead to their successful pulls . This data is persisted across reboots of the host and restarts of the kubelet.

    The kubelet ensures any image requiring credential verification is always pulled if authentication information from an image pull is not yet present, thus enforcing authentication / re-authentication. This means an image pull might be attempted even in cases where a pod requests the `IfNotPresent` image pull policy, and might lead to the pod not starting if its pull policy is `Never` and is unable to present authentication information that lead to a previous successful pull of the image it is requesting.
