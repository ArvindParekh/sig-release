  text: Added the ability to reduce both the initial delay and the maximum delay accrued
    between container restarts for a node for containers in `CrashLoopBackOff` across
    the cluster to the recommended values of `1s` initial delay and `60s` maximum
    delay. To set this for a node, turn on the feature gate `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackOffDecay`.
    If you are also using the feature gate `KubeletCrashLoopBackOffMax` with a configured
    per-node `CrashLoopBackOff.MaxContainerRestartPeriod`, the effective kubelet configuration
    will follow the conflict resolution policy described further in the documentation
    [here](TODO:link).
