  text: Fixed in-tree to CSI migration for Portworx volumes, in clusters where Portworx
    security feature is enabled (it's a Portworx feature, not Kubernetes feature).
    It required secret data from the secret mentioned in-tree SC, to be passed in
    CSI requests which was not happening before this fix.
