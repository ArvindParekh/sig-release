  text: Expanded the on-disk kubelet credential provider configuration to allow an
    optional `tokenAttribute` field to be configured. When it is set, the Kubelet
    will provision a token with the given audience bound to the current pod and its
    service account. This KSA token along with required annotations on the KSA defined
    in configuration will be sent to the credential provider plugin via its standard
    input (along with the image information that is already sent today). The KSA annotations
    to be sent are configurable in the kubelet credential provider configuration.
