    When the `StrictIPCIDRValidation` feature gate is enabled, Kubernetes will be
    slightly stricter about what values will be accepted as IP addresses and network
    address ranges ("CIDR blocks").

    In particular, octets within IPv4 addresses are not allowed to have any leading
    `0`s, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 values (e.g. `::ffff:192.168.0.1`) are forbidden.
    These sorts of values can potentially cause security problems when different
    components interpret the same string as referring to different IP addresses
    (as in CVE-2021-29923).

    This tightening applies only to fields in build-in API kinds, and not to
    custom resource kinds, values in Kubernetes configuration files, or
    command-line arguments.

    (When the feature gate is disabled, creating an object with such an invalid
    IP or CIDR value will result in a warning from the API server about the fact
    that it will be rejected in the future).
