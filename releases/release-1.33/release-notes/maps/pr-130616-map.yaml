    Fixed a test failure in `TestSetVolumeOwnershipOwner` for `fsGroup=3000` and
    symlink cases in `volume_linux_test.go`. The tests were failing due to invalid
    ownership verification and the issue has been resolved by adjusting file
    permission change handling, ensuring correct behavior when run as root.
