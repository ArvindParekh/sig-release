  text: Removed a warning related to Linux user namespaces and kernel version. Previously,
    if the feature gate `UserNamespacesSupport` was enabled, the kubelet warned when
    detecting a Linux kernel version earlier than 6.3.0. While user namespace support
    generally requires kernel 6.3 or newer, it can also work on older kernels.
