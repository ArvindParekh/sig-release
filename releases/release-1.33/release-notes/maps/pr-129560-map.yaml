  text: 'DRA: when asking for "All" devices on a node, Kubernetes <= 1.32 proceeded
    to schedule pods onto nodes with no devices by not allocating any devices for
    those pods. Kubernetes 1.33 changes that to only picking nodes which have at least
    one device. Users who want the "proceed with scheduling also without devices"
    semantic can use the upcoming prioritized list feature with one sub-request for
    "all" devices and a second alternative with "count: 0".'
