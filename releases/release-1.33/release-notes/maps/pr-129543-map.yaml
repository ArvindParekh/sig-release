  text: "DRA API: The maximum number of pods that can use the same
    ResourceClaim is now 256 instead of 32. Downgrading a cluster
    where this relaxed limit is in use to Kubernetes 1.32.0 is not
    supported, as version 1.32.0 would refuse to update ResourceClaims
    with more than 32 entries in the `status.reservedFor` field."
