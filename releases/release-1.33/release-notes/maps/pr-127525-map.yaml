  text: When `cpu-manager-policy=static` is configured, containers meeting the qualifications
    for static cpu assignment (i.e. Containers with integer CPU `requests` in pods
    with `Guaranteed` QOS) will not have cfs quota enforced. Because this fix changes
    a long-established behavior, users observing a regressions can use the `DisableCPUQuotaWithExclusiveCPUs`
    feature gate (enabled by default) to restore the previous behavior. Please file an issue if
    you encounter problems and have to use the Feature Gate.
