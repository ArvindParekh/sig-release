## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Renamed `UpdatePodTolerations` action type to `UpdatePodToleration`.
  Action required for custom plugin developers to update their code to follow the rename. ([#129023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129023), [@zhifei92](https://github.com/zhifei92)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
 - The behavior of the KUBE_PROXY_NFTABLES_SKIP_KERNEL_VERSION_CHECK environment variable has been fixed in the nftables proxier. The kernel version check is now only skipped when this variable is explicitly set to a non-empty value. If you need to skip the check, set the KUBE_PROXY_NFTABLES_SKIP_KERNEL_VERSION_CHECK environment variable. ([#130401](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130401), [@ryota-sakamoto](https://github.com/ryota-sakamoto))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- The `WatchFromStorageWithoutResourceVersion` feature was deprecated and can no longer be enabled. ([#129930](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129930), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- The v1 Endpoints API is now officially deprecated (though still fully supported). The API will not be removed, but all users should use the EndpointSlice API instead. ([#130098](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130098), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery and Network]

### API Change

- Added support for in-place vertical scaling of Pods with sidecars (containers defined within `initContainers` where the `restartPolicy` is set to `Always`). ([#128367](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128367), [@vivzbansal](https://github.com/vivzbansal)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA API: The maximum number of pods that can use the same ResourceClaim is now 256 instead of 32. Downgrading a cluster where this relaxed limit is in use to Kubernetes 1.32.0 is not supported, as version 1.32.0 would refuse to update ResourceClaims with more than 32 entries in the `status.reservedFor` field. ([#129543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129543), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Node and Testing]
- DRA: CEL expressions using attribute strings exceeded the cost limit because their cost estimation was incomplete. ([#129661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129661), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node]
- DRA: when asking for "All" devices on a node, Kubernetes <= 1.32 proceeded to schedule pods onto nodes with no devices by not allocating any devices for those pods. Kubernetes 1.33 changes that to only picking nodes which have at least one device. Users who want the "proceed with scheduling also without devices" semantic can use the upcoming prioritized list feature with one sub-request for "all" devices and a second alternative with "count: 0". ([#129560](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129560), [@bart0sh](https://github.com/bart0sh)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Implemented a new status field, `.status.terminatingReplicas`, for Deployments and ReplicaSets to track terminating pods. The new field is present when the `DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy` feature gate is enabled. ([#128546](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128546), [@atiratree](https://github.com/atiratree)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Implemented validation for `NodeSelectorRequirement` values in Kubernetes when creating pods. ([#128212](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128212), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Apps and Scheduling]
- InPlacePodVerticalScaling: Memory limits cannot be decreased unless the memory resize restart policy is set to `RestartContainer`. Container resizePolicy is no longer mutable. ([#130183](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130183), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Introduced API type coordination.k8s.io/v1beta1/LeaseCandidate ([#130291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130291), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd and Testing]
- KEP-3857: Recursive Read-only (RRO) mounts: promote to GA ([#130116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130116), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- Kubectl: Added alpha support for customizing kubectl behavior using preferences from a `kuberc` file, separate from `kubeconfig`. ([#125230](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125230), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI and Testing]
- Kubernetes components that accepted X.509 client certificate authentication now read the user UID from a certificate subject name RDN with object ID `1.3.6.1.4.1.57683.2`. An RDN with this object ID had to contain a string value and appear no more than once in the certificate subject. Reading the user UID from this RDN could be disabled by setting the beta feature gate `AllowParsingUserUIDFromCertAuth` to `false`(until the feature gate graduated to GA). ([#127897](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127897), [@modulitos](https://github.com/modulitos)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- MergeDefaultEvictionSettings indicates that defaults for the evictionHard, evictionSoft, evictionSoftGracePeriod, and evictionMinimumReclaim fields should be merged into values specified for those fields in this configuration. Signals specified in this configuration take precedence. Signals not specified in this configuration inherit their defaults. ([#127577](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127577), [@vaibhav2107](https://github.com/vaibhav2107)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Promoted the Job's JobBackoffLimitPerIndex feature-gate to stable. ([#130061](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130061), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture and Testing]
- Promoted the feature gate `AnyVolumeDataSource` to GA. ([#129770](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129770), [@sunnylovestiramisu](https://github.com/sunnylovestiramisu)) [SIG Apps, Storage and Testing]
- Removed general available feature-gate `PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`. ([#129500](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129500), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Auth]
- TODO, as the current Rease Note is very big, we are keeping it for now to
  update it later (Before the final cut). ([#128971](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128971), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Etcd, Network, Release and Testing]
- `kubectl apply` now coerces `null` values for labels and annotations in manifests to empty string values, consistent with typed JSON metadata decoding, rather than dropping all labels and annotations ([#129257](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129257), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery]

- Cel-go has been bumped to v0.23.2. ([#129844](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129844), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Node]
- Changed metadata management for Pods to populate `.metadata.generation` on writes. New pods will have a `metadata.generation` of 1; updates to mutable fields in the Pod `.spec` will result in `metadata.generation` being incremented by 1. ([#130181](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130181), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- Changed the version of Go that Kubernetes builds against. Kubernetes is now built with Go `1.23.5`. ([#129962](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129962), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]

- Extended the schema of the kube-proxy `healthz` and `livez` HTTP endpoints to incorporate information about the corresponding IP family. ([#129271](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129271), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman)) [SIG Network and Windows]
- Fixed SELinuxWarningController defaults when running kube-controller-manager in a container. ([#130037](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130037), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG Apps and Storage]
- Fixed a bug to ensure container-level swap metrics are collected. ([#129486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129486), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Graduated `BtreeWatchCache` feature gate to GA. ([#129934](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129934), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated the `KubeletFineGrainedAuthz` feature gate to beta; the gate is now enabled by default. ([#129656](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129656), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG Auth, CLI, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Implemented full support for contextual logging in  `client-go/rest`. `BackoffManagerWithContext` was used instead of  `BackoffManager` to ensure that the caller could interrupt the sleep. ([#127709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127709), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Network and Node]
- Improved how the API server responds to **list** requests where the response format negotiates to JSON. List responses in JSON are marshalled one element at the time, drastically reducing memory needed to serve large collections. Streaming list responses can be disabled via the `StreamingJSONListEncoding` feature gate. ([#129334](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129334), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture and Release]
- Improved scheduling performance of pods with required topology spreading. ([#129119](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129119), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Introduced the `LegacySidecarContainers` feature gate enabling the legacy code path that predates the `SidecarContainers` feature. This temporary feature gate is disabled by default, only available in v1.33, and will be removed in v1.34. ([#130058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130058), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the  `ServiceAccountTokenNodeBinding` feature gate general availability. It is now locked to enabled. ([#129591](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129591), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Auth and Testing]
- Kubeadm: 'kubeadm upgrade plan' now supports '--etcd-upgrade' flag to control whether the etcd upgrade plan should be displayed. Add an `EtcdUpgrade` field into `UpgradeConfiguration.Plan` for v1beta4. ([#130023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130023), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: Added preflight check for `cp` on Linux nodes and `xcopy` on Windows nodes. These binaries are required for kubeadm to work properly. ([#130045](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130045), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kubeadm: Improved `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` to provide consistent error messages when the kubelet failed or when failed to wait for control plane components. ([#130040](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130040), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Kubeadm: Promoted the feature gate `ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode` to Beta. By default, Kubeadm will use the local kube-apiserver endpoint for the kubelet when creating a cluster with `kubeadm init` or when joining control plane nodes with `kubeadm join`. Enabling the feature gate also affects the `kubeadm init phase kubeconfig kubelet` phase, where the flag `--control-plane-endpoint` no longer affects the generated kubeconfig `Server` field, but the flag `--apiserver-advertise-address` can now be used for the same purpose. ([#129956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129956), [@chrischdi](https://github.com/chrischdi))
- Kubeadm: graduated the WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents feature gate to Beta. When checking the health status of a control plane component, make sure that the address and port defined as arguments in the respective component's static Pod manifest are used. ([#129620](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129620), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate is enabled, remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from a given node on `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129279](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129279), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: if the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate is enabled, remove the flag `--container-runtime-endpoint` from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129278](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129278), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: removed preflight check for nsenter on Linux nodes
  kubeadm: added preflight check for `losetup` on Linux nodes. It's required by kubelet for keeping a block device opened. ([#129450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129450), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: removed the feature gate EtcdLearnerMode which graduated to GA in 1.32. ([#129589](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129589), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubernetes is now built with go 1.23.6 ([#130074](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130074), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built with go 1.24.0 ([#129688](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129688), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built with go `1.23.4`. ([#129422](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129422), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- NodeRestriction admission now validates that the audience value, the kubelet requested a service account token for, is part of the pod spec volume. The kube-apiserver featuregate `ServiceAccountNodeAudienceRestriction` is enabled by default in 1.33. ([#130017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130017), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- Promoted RelaxedDNSSearchValidation to beta, allowing for Pod search domains to be a single dot "." or contain an underscore "_" ([#130128](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130128), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Promoted kubectl --subresource flag to stable. ([#130238](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130238), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- Promoted the `CRDValidationRatcheting` feature gate to GA in 1.33 ([#130013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130013), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Promoted the feature gate `CSIMigrationPortworx` to GA. If your applications are using Portworx volumes, please make sure that the corresponding Portworx CSI driver is installed on your cluster **before** upgrading to 1.31 or later because all operations for the in-tree `portworxVolume` type are redirected to the pxd.portworx.com CSI driver when the feature gate is enabled. ([#129297](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129297), [@gohilankit](https://github.com/gohilankit)) [SIG Storage]
- Promoted the feature gate `HonorPVReclaimPolicy` to GA. ([#129583](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129583), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Apps, Storage and Testing]
- The `SidecarContainers` feature has graduated to GA. 'SidecarContainers' feature gate was locked to default value and will be removed in v1.36. If you were setting this feature gate explicitly, please remove it now. ([#129731](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129731), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- The nftables mode of kube-proxy is now GA. (The iptables mode remains the
  default; you can select the nftables mode by passing `--proxy-mode nftables`
  or using a config file with `mode: nftables`. See the kube-proxy documentation
  for more details.) ([#129653](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129653), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]
- Upgraded the `kubectl autoscale` subcommand to use `autoscaling/v2` rather than `autoscaling/v1` APIs. The command now attempts to use the `autoscaling/v2` API first. If the `autoscaling/v2` API is unavailable or an error occurs, it falls fall back to the `autoscaling/v1` API. ([#128950](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128950), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Autoscaling and CLI]
- Various controllers that write out IP address or CIDR values to API objects now
  ensure that they always write out the values in canonical form. ([#130101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130101), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Apps, Network and Node]
- `kubeproxy_conntrack_reconciler_deleted_entries_total` metric can be used to track cumulative sum of conntrack flows cleared by reconciler. ([#130204](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130204), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman))
- `kubeproxy_conntrack_reconciler_sync_duration_seconds` metric can now be used to track conntrack reconciliation latency. ([#130200](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130200), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman))

### Documentation

- Added an example of set-based requirements for the  `-l` / `--selector` command line option to `kubectl`. ([#129106](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129106), [@rotsix](https://github.com/rotsix))
- Kubeadm: improved the `kubeadm reset` message for manual cleanups and referenced https://k8s.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/. ([#129644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129644), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

### Bug or Regression

- --feature-gate=InOrderInformers (default on), causes informers to process watch streams in order as opposed to grouping updates for the same item close together.  Binaries embedding client-go, but not wiring the featuregates can disable by setting the `KUBE_FEATURE_InOrderInformers=false`. ([#129568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129568), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k)) [SIG API Machinery]

Each CSI driver needs to make sure correct usage of return value of IsLikelyNotMountPoint because if the file is an irregular file but not a mount point is acceptable ([#129370](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129370), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx)) [SIG Storage and Windows]
- Changed the signature of `PublishResources()` for ResourceSlices to accept a `resourceslice.DriverResources` parameter instead of a `Resources` parameter. ([#129142](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129142), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- DRA: the explanation for why a pod which wasn't using ResourceClaims was unscheduleable included a useless "no new claims to deallocate" when it was unscheduleable for some other reasons.

- Fixed a bug in HorizontalPodAutoscaler. HPAs with `ContainerResource` metrics no longer error when container metrics are missing. Instead they use the same logic as `Resource` metrics to perform calculations. ([#127193](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127193), [@DP19](https://github.com/DP19)) [SIG Apps and Autoscaling]
- Fixed a bug where adding an ephemeral container to a pod which references a new secret or config map doesn't give the pod access to that new secret or config map. (#114984, @cslink) ([#129670](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129670), [@cslink](https://github.com/cslink)) [SIG Auth]

- Fixed an issue in register-gen where imports for k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime and k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/schema were missing. ([#129307](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129307), [@LionelJouin](https://github.com/LionelJouin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixed an issue in the CEL CIDR library where subnets contained within another CIDR were incorrectly rejected as not contained. ([#130450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130450), [@JoelSpeed](https://github.com/JoelSpeed))
- Fixed an issue with Kubernetes-style sidecar containers (in other words: init containers with an Always restart policy) and Services. Before the fix, named ports exposed by a sidecar could not be accessed using a Service. ([#128850](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128850), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Fixed in-tree to CSI migration for Portworx volumes, in clusters where Portworx security feature is enabled (it's a Portworx feature, not Kubernetes feature). It required secret data from the secret mentioned in-tree SC, to be passed in CSI requests which was not happening before this fix. ([#129630](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129630), [@gohilankit](https://github.com/gohilankit)) [SIG Storage]
- Fixed the bug where Events fail to be created when the referenced object name is not a valid Event name.

- Implemented logging and event recording for probe results with an `Unknown` status in the kubelet's prober module. This helped improve the diagnosis and monitoring of cases where container probes returned an `Unknown` result, enhancing the observability and reliability of health checks. ([#125901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125901), [@jralmaraz](https://github.com/jralmaraz))
- Improved reboot event reporting. The kubelet will only emit one reboot Event when a server-level reboot is detected, even if the kubelet cannot write its status to the associated Node (which triggers a retry). ([#129151](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129151), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-apiserver: --service-account-max-token-expiration can now be used in combination with an external token signer --service-account-signing-endpoint, as long as the --service-account-max-token-expiration is not longer than the external token signer's max expiration. ([#129816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129816), [@sambdavidson](https://github.com/sambdavidson)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]

- Kube-proxy, when using a Service with External or LoadBalancer IPs on UDP services , was consuming a large amount of CPU because it was not filtering by the Service destination port and trying to delete all the UDP entries associated to the service. ([#130484](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130484), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network]
- Kube-proxy: fixed a potential memory leak which can occur in clusters with high volume of UDP workflows. ([#130032](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130032), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman))
- Kubeadm: Avoided loading the file passed to `--kubeconfig` during `kubeadm init` phases more than once. ([#129006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129006), [@kokes](https://github.com/kokes))

- Kubeadm: fixed the bug where the v1beta4 Timeouts.EtcdAPICall field was not respected in etcd client operations, and the default timeout of 2 minutes was always used. ([#129859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129859), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if an addon is disabled in the ClusterConfiguration, skip it during upgrade. ([#129418](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129418), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: run kernel version and OS version preflight checks for `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129401](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129401), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Provides an additional function argument to directly specify the version for the tools that the consumers wished to use. ([#129658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129658), [@unmarshall](https://github.com/unmarshall))
- Removed the limitation on exposing port 10250 externally using a Service. ([#129174](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129174), [@RyanAoh](https://github.com/RyanAoh)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Resolved a performance regression in default 1.31+ configurations, related to the ConsistentListFromCache feature, where rapid create/update API requests across different namespaces encounter increased latency. ([#130113](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130113), [@AwesomePatrol](https://github.com/AwesomePatrol))
- The /flagz endpoint in kube-apiserver now correctly returns parsed flag values when the feature-gate ComponentFlagz is enabled ([#130328](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130328), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- The following roles have had `Watch` added to them (prefixed with `system:controller:`):
  
  - `cronjob-controller`
  - `endpoint-controller`
  - `endpointslice-controller`
  - `endpointslicemirroring-controller`
  - `horizontal-pod-autoscaler`
  - `node-controller`
  - `pod-garbage-collector`

- The response from kube-apiserver's `/flagz` endpoint would respond correctly with parsed flags value. ([#129996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129996), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Testing]
- When `cpu-manager-policy=static` is configured, containers meeting the qualifications for static cpu assignment (i.e. Containers with integer CPU `requests` in pods with `Guaranteed` QOS) will not have cfs quota enforced. Because this fix changes a long-established behavior, users observing a regressions can use the `DisableCPUQuotaWithExclusiveCPUs` feature gate (enabled by default) to restore the previous behavior. Please file an issue if you encounter problems and have to use the Feature Gate. ([#127525](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127525), [@scott-grimes](https://github.com/scott-grimes)) [SIG Node and Testing]
