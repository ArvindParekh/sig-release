# Resignation
Voluntary resignation is outlined in the [shadow handbook](https://github.com/leonardpahlke/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/shadows.md). Role lead should discuss with Release Lead and Emiritus Advisor to find a replacement if they would like to step down.

# Removal Process
Remaining on the team without contributing creates an unhealthy environment for the rest of the team, and negatively affect the outcome of the release. We strive to be inclusive and empathetic to individuals circumstances. 
The following outline is not meant to be definitive or punitive but rather outlines general guidance for leads on the process.  
## Shadow Removal Guideline

Reasons for removal could be including but not limited to:
- Failure to attend shadow orientation hosted by EA (we host 2-3 sessions in different timezone)
- Failure to attend shadow orientation hosted by role lead (if lead doesn't offer timezone-appropriate meeting, shadow should communicate to lead about obtaining and watching the recording)
- Failure to attend 3 consecutive release meeting without communication to role lead
- Failure to perform shadow tasks in due time, after 2 discussions with role lead about performance
- Unresponsive on Slack to messages for more than 2 days during non-peak time and 24 hours during peak time, without prior notice of absence. Peak time is different depending on the team's responsibility
- Violation of [CNCF Code of Conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/)

Note that communications ahead of time to inform the leads or find alternative arrangements are greatly preferred in these circumstances.
### Process
It is important to be kind and patient while trying to resolve the situation.
- Upon a pattern of inactivity, role lead will notify EA and have initial discussion with shadows about performance.
- If the shadow is still not contributing to the team, EA and lead will remove shadow from team, and find replacement if appropriate. EA will be responsible to find backfill.

### Consequences
- If the current release is the reason the shadow has Kubernetes membership, membership should be revoked
- Removal of name in release-team document
- Shadow will not be able to return to the following release. However, they are welcome to apply to releases after that.

# Role Lead
A role lead has been selected by your previous team lead to supervise, perform the duties of your team 
and mentor your shadows to be future leads. Failure to perform lead duty can have a lasting impact on the release team.
Reasons for removal could be including but not limited to:
- Failure to attend or send appropriate representation to 2 consecutive release meetings
- Failure to perform tasks expected of a role lead
- Unresponsive on Slack to messages for more than 2 days during non-peak time and 24 hours during peak time, without prior notice of absence. Peak time is different depending on team
- Violation of [CNCF Code of Conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/)

### Process
- SIGs outside of SIG-release, shadows, leads, or contributors can express concern to release lead or EA.
- Release lead and EA will have initial discussion with role lead
- If the situation is not improved, release lead and EA will have another discussion with role lead and begin to look for replacement.
- If deemed necessary by release lead, EA and sig-release chairs, role lead will be replaced with an experience shadow or someone who previously lead the same role. EA will be responsible to find backfill
  
### Consequences
- Removal of name in release-team document
- Role lead will need to shadow again and demonstrate sufficient responsibility, and leading ability, before holding another leadership position on the release team

# Appeal
If the release team member disagrees with their removal decision. They can escalate to SIG-Release chairs via private messaging on Slack.
