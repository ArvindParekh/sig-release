This message is sent to SIGs, in their channel, to collect the Release Highlights for the release cycle.

```
Hi SIG @xxx ðŸ‘‹ 

this is <Comms shadow/lead name> from the <current release cycle version> Communications Team! 

Release Highlights are an essential part of the Kubernetes release cycle as they provide a birds-eye view of improvements, breaking or user-facing changes that are coming as part of the upcoming release.

Release Comms team is asking for your help gathering your Release Highlights for this release. If you have anything to call out, we would appreciate it if your SIG can submit the content in Kubernetes <current release cycle version> Release Highlights [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/xxxx).

Ideally, we would like this to be completed by **<deadline>**.

Thank you so much for your cooperation :smile:
