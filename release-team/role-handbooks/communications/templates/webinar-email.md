Hi!

I'm the Communications Lead for Kubernetes <release-version>, and I'm reaching out to schedule a live webinar for our Release and Enhancements Leads, reading in CC.
This version is currently scheduled to be released on the <release date>, see the details here: https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/

Could you help us to schedule the webinar?
Do you have availability sometime for 3-4 weeks after the release? We can work around your schedule.

Thanks!
