# Role Lead
As a role lead, you are chosen by your previous team lead to supervise, perform the duties of your team 
and mentor your shadows to be future leads.

## What happens when my shadow is not participating?
As outlined in the (shadows handbook)[https://github.com/leonardpahlke/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/shadows.md], 
a shadow may become unresponsive for a number of reasons. It is important to be kind and patient while trying to resolve the situation.
If you have received communications that they are unable to
continue with the release or notice a pattern of unresponsiveness, please contact the EA as soon as possible 
so they can support you in making alternative arrangements. If necessary and in exceedingly rare cases, 
this may mean removing the shadow from the team. If it is early on in the release, the leadership team might be able to 
recruit to your team another shadow, or coordinate additional support to you in other ways.

Poor performance as a shadow will be noted by the lead and EA, and can result in not being selected for future releases.

## What happens when I am unable to fulfill my roles?
It is paramount that you fulfill the duties outlined in your handbook. Failure to do so as a lead will negatively affect the release.

Poor performance as a shadow will be noted by the lead and EA, and can result in not being selected for future releases.
